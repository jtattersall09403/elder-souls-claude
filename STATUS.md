# Where we are right now

**Last updated: 2026-08-14, late evening.** One screen. If this is more than a day old, distrust it and say so.

## What the agents are working on this minute

**Making the game look like a game.** Specifically: surfaces responding to light, and things sitting *on* the ground instead of floating above it.

Alongside that: shrinking the documentation every agent reads before it can start (done today — 145k tokens down to 69k).

## If you play right now, expect this

**It is a slice, not a game.** You can walk around, look at things, open the map and journal, talk to people, and fight. It will not look good yet.

**Better than it was:**
- The world has hills and distance instead of grey haze.
- Edges are clean instead of jagged.
- Surfaces have just started responding to light properly — this landed hours ago and is the first thing you might actually notice.
- You come out of character creation in **Thorn** facing somewhere sensible, through a door that now exists (it was drawn as a solid wall).
- The map opens, shows the whole province, and hides only the markers you haven't found.

**Still wrong, and you will see it:**
- Shadowed areas crush to black with no detail.
- **Characters had no bodies for part of today — fixed a few minutes ago.** A shader failed to link, so
  head, arms, legs and torso did not draw at all while horns, eyes, frills and equipment did. If you
  looked at the game this evening, that is what you saw. **124 of 124 programs now link** and the full
  figure renders, confirmed at eight orbit angles. Whether the characters look *good* is a separate,
  still-open question — that needs the reference set, which is now on disk.
- **Nothing casts a contact shadow** — *fixed today, not yet judged.* The old "ambient occlusion" turned
  out to be an edge detector that was structurally blind to exactly this. Real occlusion has replaced
  it. Shadows still crush to black; that fix is being built now.
- Dialogue is shallow — asking about one topic mostly does not open others. Being fixed.
- Some buildings still overlap each other; 24 doors still open into another building.

## The honest standard

**Do not assume anything is "delivered to 7/10" yet.** The bar is min-over-axes ≥ 7.0 and the visual work currently scores **5** — measured, not guessed: the first blind comparison against real reference plates ran on 14 August and **our images lost 5 out of 5**.

When a step here says *done*, it means done to the bar and independently checked. Nothing above says that yet.

## Roadmap

**Rebuilt 2026-08-14 from the repo** — `orchestration/ROADMAP.md`. 8 rings, 69 items, covering all
**149 reference items, 49 plans and 79 open gaps**, with the coverage proven by a generator that exits
non-zero if anything has no home. The previous one was written from memory and left the camera, the
main quest, travel, inventory and endings out entirely.

**We are in ring 1 — the frame.** Materials landed today; shadows and ambient occlusion are being
built now. Rings 2–7 (the fight, the world, the character, quests, platform, the whole thing) are
enumerated and not started.

## Cost

Roughly **37% of the weekly budget** spent, in about nine hours. The approach changed this evening: fewer agents at once, working sequentially, with cheaper models on mechanical work — so that the remaining budget lasts the week rather than ending on Saturday.
